Bitcoin when used on a mobile device allows you to pay with a simple two-step scan-and-pay.
There's no need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything.
All you need to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code 
in your Bitcoin wallet app and let the other party scan your mobile, 
or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).
